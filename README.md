## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first jump back into HTML and CSS in a few months if not longer. I reaquainted myself with the syling and specifically had to look back into media queries for making the website responsive.

### Continued development

I want to look back into CSS Flexbox and Grid and refresh myself on those aspects to make the responsiveness easier.
